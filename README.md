## Abstract
We present a new strategy for performing global sensitivity analysis capable to estimate main and interaction effects from a generic sampling design. The new strategy is based on an effective combination of variance- and distribution-based approaches. The strategy is tested on four analytic functions and on a hydrological model. Results show that the analysis is consistent with the state-of-the-art Sobol/Jansen formula but requires a smaller number of simulations runs. Some possible improvements on setting the new strategy are discussed. The strategy is considered as a new simple approach for global sensitivity analysis that could be easily integrated in any environmental modelling framework.
